# Name-the-Capital

This is a quiz game I made for my cousin using Python. 

Credit to http://automatetheboringstuff.com/ for the idea. 

The game ask the player to name the capital of 10 countries, selected at random from a list of 198 countries. 

The date is taken from the accompanied Data.xlsx.
